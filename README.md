# Portfolio built with Rjs

## Components

My portfolio was constructed using 6 different components: Header, Nav, About, Project, Contact, Footer.
A HashedRouter is used to direct the user to each initiated path.

## Data

For now my projects are brought in from a seperate file that was hard coded. Eventually, I plan to create the server side code to be able to post projects and have them dynamically generated into a card without having to hardcode them, as that's how my previous portfolio functions.
